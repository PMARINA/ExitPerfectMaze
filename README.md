<h1>Undirected Graphs - Getting out of the Maze</h1>
<p>Given an N-by-N maze (like the one created in the previous exercise), write a program to find a path from the start cell (1, 1) to the finish cell (N, N), if it exists. To find a solution to the maze, run the following algorithm, starting from (1, 1) and stopping if we reach cell (N, N).</p>
